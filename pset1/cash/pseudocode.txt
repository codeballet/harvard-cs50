Calculate amount of coins to give a certain amount of change.

Avaliable coins:
 - 1c
 - 5c
 - 10c
 - 25c

Use a greedy algorithm.

TODO

1. Promt user for amount of change.
 - Type in some amount of dollars
 - use get_float() with decimals
 - check that the input is non-negative with a do-while loop
 - convert the number of dollars to cents by multiplying with 100
 - round the number of cents to nearest penny
 - use function round() from math.h
 
2. Use the largest coins possible, keep track of coins used.
 - keep track of remaining change owd
 - keep track of how many coins used
 - Alternative 1: use loops:
  - While we can use quarters, add a quarter.
  - While we can use dimes, add a dime.
  - etc.
 - Alternative 2: check for remainders from using each coin.

3. Print the number of coins.
 - use a placeholder for a variable
 - printf("%i\n", coins);

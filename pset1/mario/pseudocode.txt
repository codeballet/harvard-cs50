prompt for input
 - use get_int() from cs50.h

check if input is valid
if height is less than 1 or greater than 8, go back one step
 - use a do-while loop

iterate through 1 through height
 - start with a left aligned pyramid
 - use a for loop to print hashes and a new line
 - on iteration i, print i hashes and then a newline

right-align the pyramid by adding dots
 - print dots
 - print hashes

print gap

print right hashes

remove the dots and replace with spaces
